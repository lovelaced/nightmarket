# Nightmarket

**Anonymous decentralized marketplace operating exclusively during night hours (06:00-05:00 UTC)**

Privacy-preserving peer-to-peer commerce using zero-knowledge location proofs, encrypted listings, and dead drop coordination.

---

## Overview

Nightmarket enables anonymous physical goods exchange through:

- **Zero-Knowledge Location Proofs** - Prove presence in a zone without revealing exact coordinates
- **Global Zone Grid** - Automatic zone detection from GPS (works anywhere on Earth)
- **Encrypted Listings** - AES-256-GCM encryption with zone-based keys
- **Progressive Dead Drop Protocol** - 4-stage coordinate revelation for secure exchanges
- **Privacy-Preserving Transactions** - Mixer pools anonymize fund flows
- **Anonymous Reputation** - Prove score >= threshold without revealing exact score
- **Time-Restricted Operations** - Market only accessible during configured hours

---

## Architecture

### Smart Contracts (Rust/PolkaVM)

5 contracts deployed on Paseo Asset Hub Testnet:

1. **NightmarketZones** (20 KB) - Location proof verification, time validation, global grid support
2. **NightmarketListings** (23 KB) - Encrypted marketplace with auto-expiry
3. **NightmarketEscrow** (25 KB) - Multi-party escrow, staged reveals, dispute resolution
4. **NightmarketMixer** (21 KB) - Deposit pooling, anonymous withdrawals, fee tracking
5. **NightmarketReputation** (20 KB) - Score management, ZK threshold proofs, decay mechanics

**Total:** 109 KB of optimized PolkaVM bytecode

### ZK Circuits (Circom/Groth16)

3 production circuits with trusted setup:

- **location_proof.circom** - 2,022 constraints (897 non-linear, 1,125 linear)

## How It Works

### For Sellers

1. Open app → Zone automatically detected from GPS
2. Generate location proof (ZK-SNARK, 5-10 seconds)
3. Create listing with 4-stage dead drop coordinates
4. Listing encrypted and published on-chain
5. Buyers with valid zone proofs can decrypt
6. Coordinates revealed progressively during trade

### For Buyers

1. Generate location proof for your zone
2. Browse encrypted listings (auto-decrypt if in zone)
3. Initiate purchase → Funds locked in escrow
4. Receive stage 1 coordinates (general area)
5. Stage 2-4 revealed as trade progresses
6. Complete pickup → Funds released to seller

## Security Features

**Implemented:**
- ✅ Zero-knowledge location proofs
- ✅ AES-256-GCM listing encryption
- ✅ Cross-contract verification
- ✅ Integer overflow protection
- ✅ Access control enforcement
- ✅ Input validation
- ✅ Fee tracking and withdrawal
- ✅ Night-time enforcement
- ✅ 16 critical vulnerabilities fixed

**Phase 1 Limitations:**
- ⚠️ ZK proof verification uses placeholder (basic validation only)
- ⚠️ Fixed withdrawal amounts in mixer
- ⚠️ Browser-based signal fingerprinting (not true WiFi/cellular)
- ⚠️ Requires professional security audit before mainnet

## Key Innovations

### 1. Global Zone Grid System

Every location on Earth is automatically in a zone (0.05° × 0.05° grid cells ~5.5km).

No manual zone selection or configuration required:
```typescript
const location = await getGPS();
const zone = globalZoneGrid.getZoneForCoordinates(location);
// zone.id = deterministic hash of grid coordinates
```

### 2. Progressive Coordinate Revelation

Dead drop locations revealed in 4 stages as escrow advances:

- **Stage 1:** General area (1km) - visible to all buyers
- **Stage 2:** Approximate block (100m) - revealed on fund lock
- **Stage 3:** Exact location (1m) - revealed on confirmation
- **Stage 4:** Visual markers - revealed on arrival

Protects both parties and minimizes information leakage.

### 3. Zone-Based Encryption

Encryption keys deterministically derived from zone + date:

```typescript
key = HKDF-SHA256(zone_id || date || salt)
```

Same zone + same date = same key (all users in zone can decrypt)
Different zone or different date = cannot decrypt

### 4. Cross-Contract ZK Verification

Modular proof system with contract composition:

```
User → verifyLocationProof() → Zones contract
      ↓
User → createListing() → Listings contract
      ↓
Listings → hasValidProof()? → Zones contract ✓
```

Allows upgrading verification logic without redeploying marketplace.
